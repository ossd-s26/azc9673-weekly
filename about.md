Some information about me!

### More Information

Hi I'm Albert, I'm a 4th year CS major at CAS with plans to become a fintech software engineer in the future! I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area (in California), though if you'd ask me to pick between home and NYC, I'd have a really hard time choosing which is better. My current favorite hobbies are playing video games, reviewing movies and shows, getting rallies in tennis or pickleball, and hiking (though I get to do more of that at home than at school). I have most coding experience building backend applications in Java and Python, which is what I spent most of my job doing, though I have light experiences in other fields due to my past classes and personal projects. Feel free to ask or reach out!
