## What is Open Source to Me?

When I hear the term open source, I think of software that is built openly by a community and shared so others can learn from it, use it, and improve it. One of the biggest advantages of open source compared to closed source is transparency, since anyone can inspect the code, find bugs, or suggest improvements. It also encourages collaboration and faster innovation, especially because developers can build on existing work instead of starting from scratch. 

I decided to take a class on open source software development because many of the tools I already use are open source, and I wanted to better understand how those projects actually function. This course goes beyond writing code by emphasizing communication, community norms, and responsible contribution, which are easy to overlook but clearly important. Learning how open source projects are organized and maintained feels directly useful for my future work, especially if I want to contribute to or rely on open source software in a professional setting.

## What OS Projects do I use?

As part of my multiple internships working in different backend and database systems, many open source projects have been invaluable to my near daily work: 1. OpenJDK is an open source package that lets me use the JDK for both educational and work-related Java coding; 2. MySQL is an incredible database system with a host of useful tools; 3. Homebrew is a near necessary tool on iOS machines (like my work PC) to download packages not available through approved means like the app store; 4. VS Code, which I am using right now, is itself an Open Source Project and is used in nearly every aspect of my work, and is by far my favorite IDE to use.
